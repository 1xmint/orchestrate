# Build state

Resume point for building the `orchestrate` skill.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-09-09, complete

Plan: `C:\Users\Josh\.claude\plans\i-want-you-to-eager-boole.md` (grounded
2026-09-08 against Claude Code 2.1.266 docs; the desktop app runs 2.1.260).
Step numbers below are its section 8.

| step | what | status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | reference drift fixes; `ladder.md`; `lanes.md` | done, 60beeaa |
| 2 | `router.mjs` + `lib/tier.mjs` + tests; `install.mjs --with-router/--with-hook` with merge, dedupe by basename, backup, `{{SKILL_DIR}}` templating | done, 36b0f60 + 6ec6d87 |
| 3 | `guard-agent.mjs` v2 (downgrade, not deny), `ledger.mjs` (SubagentStop), `return-check.mjs`, `turn-check.mjs`; agent files gain `hooks:` and, on two roles, `memory: user` | done, a6f54dd |
| 4 | `profile.mjs --brief` with a 24 h provider cache and the skills line; `gate.mjs`; `run-init.mjs` prefills the GATE block; SKILL.md v0.4; the who-reviews rule; the manager's own model in the router | done, 4f5dee4 |
| 5 | `install.mjs --project` (gate.json, exclude, a 12-line rules file, the `@AGENTS.md` fix) + fixture tests + one `--dry-run` on notelocus | done, b8ec326 |
| 6 | `measure.mjs`, `router.mjs --cost`, the loading checklist in the README | done, 26ac889 |
| 7 | `package.mjs --spec`, README, version 0.4.0, STATE, HANDOFF, tag | done |

Proof, all at zero model quota:

- 98 unit tests, `node --test "skills/orchestrate/scripts/**/*.test.mjs"`.
- The installer's merge run against a copy of the real `~/.claude/settings.json`
  in the test suite, and then for real: the `memory-write-gate.mjs` entry is
  untouched, every non-hook key is identical, and a backup exists under
  `~/.claude/orchestrate/`.
- The installed router answered a live payload with the card and the correct
  `/orchestrate` hint.
- `measure.mjs` run on a real transcript of this build session.
- `install.mjs --project --dry-run` on the real notelocus checkout: it reports
  the pytest and ruff gate and the missing `CLAUDE.md`, and writes nothing.

### Left for Josh

1. **The five loading checks** in the README, in one fresh desktop session.
   They need a session this build cannot open, and they are the only claims in
   the README that a test does not already cover.
2. **A real orchestration**, then `measure.mjs --latest`. Until then the
   efficiency numbers in the plan's section 2a are reasoned estimates from
   documented figures, not measurements. The script is ready and free.
3. **`subagent_type: fork`** is documented but absent from this session's agent
   list. `lanes.md` marks the fork rung "documented, unverified here". One
   one-line haiku dispatch would settle it.
4. **Dynamic workflows** are not exposed as a tool here, so the skill hands
   Josh the one-line prompt to type. Re-check after a desktop update.

### Not built, on purpose

The Haiku per-turn classifier (Josh chose off; the mechanism does not exist:
a `type: prompt` hook on `UserPromptSubmit` can only return ok/reason).
Baseline-versus-skill metered sessions, the skill-creator eval loop, and a
dogfood goal: Josh's own use is the dogfood.

## v0.3.0 and earlier — 2026-09-08

Repo skeleton, references, six role agents, the RUN.md template, the first
scripts, SKILL.md, a cold-reader pass (15 findings applied) and a
fresh-context Fable audit (17 findings, the mechanical ones applied).
Deliberately not applied then: a per-run absolute Fable cap (a per-day cap in
the hook replaced it), moving the task table out of RUN.md, and marking every
host assumption unverified line by line.

Pickup prompt: v0.4.0 is complete and tagged; the next move is Josh running
the five loading checks and then using the skill on a real goal.
Pickup confidence: high
Resume risk: none
